Designing an end-to-end system for MRI data analysis on an HPC involves several key steps. Let's break down the process:

### 1. Data Transfer:
- **From Local Network Drive to HPC**: Given the limited space on your local network drive (50 GB), you'll need to transfer data in manageable batches. Each MRI file being around 5 GB means you can batch process 5-10 files per transfer.

### 2. Preparing Data for Processing:
- **File Format**: Ensure all MRI data files (.h5 and pcvirp files) are correctly formatted and accessible for processing on the HPC.
- **Organizing Files**: Maintain a clear directory structure to easily navigate and access files during processing.

### 3. Setting up the HPC Environment:
- **Slurm Scheduler**: This will manage job scheduling on the HPC cluster. Jobs can be submitted with specific resource requests (CPU, memory, time).
- **Batch Processing**: Define how many MRI files (5-10) can be processed in one batch job considering your storage constraints.

### 4. Analysis Pipeline:
- **Pipeline Components**: Define and implement the steps of your analysis pipeline. This might include preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, etc.
- **Tools**: Identify and install necessary software tools and dependencies required for MRI data analysis on the HPC.

### 5. Workflow Execution:
- **Job Submission**: Develop scripts to automate job submission to the Slurm scheduler. Each batch job should handle a subset of MRI files within the storage limits.
- **Monitoring**: Implement mechanisms to monitor job progress and resource usage to ensure efficient processing.

### 6. Data Management and Storage:
- **Temporary Storage**: Utilize temporary storage on the HPC for intermediate results during processing.
- **Output Storage**: Define where cleaned MRI data and analysis results will be stored post-processing.

### 7. Error Handling and Logging:
- **Error Handling**: Incorporate error-checking mechanisms into your scripts to handle failures gracefully.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track data transfers, job executions, and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Next Steps:
- **Detailed Planning**: Create a detailed plan outlining file transfer procedures, job submission scripts, and pipeline implementation.
- **Testing**: Conduct testing with a subset of data to validate the workflow and identify potential issues.
- **Documentation**: Document the entire process, including setup instructions, scripts, and workflows for future reference.
